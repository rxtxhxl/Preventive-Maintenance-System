# OJT Daily Wireframe Log

## Day 1 (February 11, 2025)
**Tasks:**
- Designed initial wireframes for the Preventive Maintenance System.
- Created five wireframes: the first four display colleges and months, categorized as A (Annual), SA (Semi-Annual), and Q (Quarterly). These are grouped as Set A.
- The Preventive Maintenance Checklist for Server/Data Center (Monthly View) includes maintenance tasks, specifications, and status indicators (e.g., "Good" or "Needs Maintenance").
- In the prototype, the Next Page button navigates forward, and clicking on a college directs users to the Preventive Maintenance Checklist for Server/Data Center (Monthly View).
